Functions defined here are related to rounding and used as a lib.
These functions should use <round_in:f37_waypoints_RAM> as input 
and <round_out:f37_waypoints_RAM> as output. The state of the 
input may change to an arbitrary value and should not be relied upon.
Input and output should be scaled by a factor of 10.
